> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-1` to kick off the interactive experience.

## ▶️ Reminder on How to Get Started

⚠️ **If you haven't cloned the repository yet:** Go back to [Module 0.2: Start Claude Code & Clone the Course](/getting-started/start-and-clone) first. You'll need the course files on your computer to continue.


**There are two ways to launch this course in Claude Code:**

### Option One: Find it in the File Explorer

Navigate to your Documents folder and find the `claude-code-pm-course` folder. Then right-click and select "New Terminal at Folder"

It will look something like this:

![Opening folder from file explorer](/images/folder-location.png)

Then type `claude` and hit Enter

### Option Two: Open it from the Terminal

Type these commands into your terminal:
```bash
cd ~/Documents/claude-code-pm-course
claude
```

This navigates to your course folder and opens Claude Code directly inside it.

**Either way, you end up at the same place. Then, to start this module:**

> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-1` to kick off the interactive experience.

This is how you will start every module!

## 📖 Overview

│   └── [files youll create during exercises]
└── CLAUDE.md - Project memory (visible in Obsidian)
```

**Note:** The `.claude/` folder (for commands, agents, settings) exists but is hidden. Youll work with it in later modules.

## ⏱️ Time Commitment

**Per Module:** 15-30 minutes
**Per Level:** 2-4 hours
**Full Course:** 20-30 hours

**But:** You can go at your own pace!
- Do one module at a time
- Take breaks between levels
- Come back anytime (progress is saved)

### What You Will See

Throughout the course, youll see Claude running commands like:

```
⏺ Read(company-context/COMPANY.md)
  ⎿  Read 45 lines

⏺ Bash(ls -la company-context/)
  ⎿  Listed 4 files
```

**Dont worry about understanding those!** Theyre Claude working behind the scenes. You just focus on the PM work.

### Permission Prompts

Occasionally, youll see prompts asking:
Do you want to allow this command?

**Just click:** Yes and dont ask again

This lets Claude work smoothly without asking permission every time.
