## 1.4: Agents for Parallel Work

 - **Time to Complete:** 25 minutes
 - **Prerequisites:** Module 1.3 (File operations and @ references)


> **Start this module in Claude Code:** Run `/start-1-4` to kick off the interactive experience.

## 📖 Overview

Module 1.4 introduces **agents** - independent instances of Claude that run in parallel. Instead of processing 10 meeting notes sequentially (50 minutes), spin up 10 agents to work simultaneously (5 minutes).

**Key takeaway:** Agents transform Claude Code from a single assistant into a scalable team. This isn't just faster - it unlocks entirely new workflows.


## 🤯 What Are Agents?

### The Core Concept

**Agents are independent instances of Claude that run in parallel.**

Think of it like cloning yourself to work on multiple tasks simultaneously:

**Sequential work (without agents):**
```
Task 1 (5 min) → Task 2 (5 min) → Task 3 (5 min) → ... → Task 10 (5 min)
Total time: 50 minutes
```

**Parallel work (with agents):**
```
Task 1 (5 min) ┐
Task 2 (5 min) │
Task 3 (5 min) ├─→ All happen simultaneously
...            │
Task 10 (5 min)┘
Total time: 5 minutes
```

### Agent Capabilities

| Each agent has | Each agent does NOT have |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| Full file system access | Communication with other agents |
| All Claude's capabilities | Shared state |
| Independent context | Knowledge of other agents' results (until synthesis) |
| Tool use (read/write files) | Sequential dependencies |


## 🎯 When to Use Agents

### Decision Framework

| Scenario | Use Agents? | Agent Count |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Batch processing (10 meetings, 20 interviews) | ✅ Yes | Many (5-20+) |
| Parallel research (5 competitors, 3 markets) | ✅ Yes | Few (2-5) |
| Multi-source analysis (interviews + surveys + tickets) | ✅ Yes | Few (2-4) |
| Single task | ❌ No | 0 - Just use Claude |
| Sequential work (tasks depend on each other) | ❌ No | 0 |
| Quick tasks (takes seconds) | ❌ No | 0 |

### Use Agents For:

- **Batch processing:** Same type of work on many items
- **Parallel research:** Research multiple entities independently
- **Multi-source analysis:** Different analysis on different sources
- **Time-sensitive work:** Need results in hours, not days

### Skip Agents For:

- Single tasks (just prompt Claude directly)
- Sequential work (tasks that depend on each other)
- Quick tasks (simple requests taking seconds)
- Context-dependent work (needs to build on previous work)


## 🔧 How to Prompt for Agents

### Pattern 1: Explicit Agent Request

```
Create 10 agents to process the 10 meeting notes in /meetings.
Each agent should extract:
- Key decisions
- Action items
- Blockers
- Next steps

Combine all results into @weekly-summary.md
```

### Pattern 2: Let Claude Decide

```
I have 15 competitor websites to research for features and pricing.
Work in parallel to get this done quickly.
```

### Pattern 3: Specialized Agents

```
Launch 3 specialized agents:
- Agent 1: Analyze all interview transcripts in /interviews
- Agent 2: Process survey data in @survey-results.csv
- Agent 3: Review support tickets in /support

Synthesize findings into @user-research-insights.md
```


## 💼 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Meeting Processing

**Scenario:** Monday morning, 10 meeting transcripts, standup in 1 hour.

**Prompt:**
```
I have 10 meeting transcripts in /meetings/last-week/.

Create 10 agents to process each meeting simultaneously.

For each meeting, extract:
- Key decisions made
- Action items (with owners and due dates)
- Blockers or risks raised

Synthesize ALL findings into @monday-standup-prep.md with:
- Section 1: Critical blockers
- Section 2: Key decisions
- Section 3: Action items by team member
```

**Result:** 5 minutes vs 60 minutes sequential work.

### Example 2: Competitive Research

**Scenario:** CEO needs competitive analysis on 5 competitors by end of day.

**Prompt:**
```
Launch 5 agents to research these competitors simultaneously:
- Asana, Linear, Monday.com, ClickUp, Notion

For each competitor, research:
- Product features and capabilities
- Pricing tiers and packaging
- Target market and positioning
- Recent updates (last 6 months)
- User reviews and sentiment

Create individual files: @competitor-[name]-research.md

Then synthesize into @competitive-analysis.md with:
- Feature comparison matrix
- Pricing comparison
- Positioning map
- Gaps and opportunities
```

**Result:** 1 hour vs 5.5 hours sequential work.


## 🎨 Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Fan-Out Processing

**Use for:** Multiple similar tasks, need all results combined

```
Process all 15 files in /meetings/ with 15 agents.
Extract action items from each.
Combine into single action item list grouped by owner.
```

### Pattern 2: Specialized Roles

**Use for:** Different types of analysis on different sources

```
Launch 3 specialized agents:
- Agent 1 (Interview Expert): Analyze qualitative data
- Agent 2 (Data Analyst): Process survey numbers
- Agent 3 (Support Analyst): Categorize ticket themes

Synthesize into comprehensive user research report.
```

### Pattern 3: Parallel Research

**Use for:** Research multiple entities independently

```
Research these 5 competitors in parallel.
Each agent creates detailed profile.
Synthesize into comparison matrix.
```

### Pattern 4: Batch Document Generation

**Use for:** Create multiple similar documents

```
From @prd.md, generate 20 user stories with acceptance criteria.
Use agents to create stories in parallel.
Ensure consistency in format and quality.
```

### Pattern 5: Validation Pipeline

**Use for:** Review multiple documents for quality

```
Review all PRDs in /docs/prds/ against our quality checklist.
Each agent reviews one PRD.
Create summary report of issues and recommendations.
```


## 💡 Best Practices

### Do:

- **Use for time-sensitive batch work** - When you need results fast
- **Let Claude decide agent count** - "Process these files in parallel" works great
- **Provide clear individual task instructions** - Each agent needs to know what to do
- **Request synthesis** - Tell Claude to combine agent results meaningfully
- **Specify output format** - Standardize agent outputs for easier synthesis

### Don't:

- **Don't use for single tasks** - Just prompt Claude directly
- **Don't create agents that need to communicate** - They work independently
- **Don't use for sequential work** - Tasks with dependencies should be done in order
- **Don't forget synthesis** - Raw agent outputs need combining
- **Don't over-agent small tasks** - If it takes 30 seconds, don't use agents


## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Agents aren't working in parallel?**
- Say explicitly: "Create agents to work in parallel" or "Simultaneously process"
- Use phrases like "at the same time"

**Agent results are inconsistent?**
- Provide clear template:
  ```
  Each agent should output markdown with these sections:
  ## Summary
  ## Key Findings
  ## Recommendations
  ```

**Too many agents created?**
- Specify exact count: "Create exactly 5 agents"
- Or provide constraint: "Use as many agents as needed, max 10"

**No synthesis after agents finish?**
- Always end with: "After all agents complete, synthesize results into @summary.md"

**One agent failed?**
- Check error message for specific issue
- Ensure all referenced files exist
- Verify instructions are clear


## 🚀 What's Next?

You now understand ad-hoc agents - temporary agents created on-the-fly for specific parallel tasks.

**Module 1.5** introduces **custom sub-agents** - permanent team members with personalities, specializations, and visual identities (emojis and colors!). Instead of "act like an engineer" every time, you'll have a 👨‍💻 Engineer sub-agent you can call anytime.

**The difference:**
- **Module 1.4 (ad-hoc agents):** Temporary clones for parallel processing
- **Module 1.5 (custom sub-agents):** Permanent specialized team members

Interactive track: Type `/start-1-5`
