## Review & Challenge Framework

When reviewing strategy documents:

### Questions to Ask
1. **Clarity**: Can someone outside the team understand this?
2. **Measurability**: How will we know if we succeeded?
3. **Feasibility**: Do we have the resources and skills?
4. **Alignment**: Does this connect to company goals?
5. **Differentiation**: Why us? Why now?

### Red Flags
- [ ] No clear success metrics
- [ ] Missing trade-offs (everything is priority)
- [ ] No timeline or milestones
- [ ] Vague resource requirements
- [ ] No risk acknowledgment
